\title{Robustness of treatment effects}
\usage{
effect_robustness(dif.models, irt.scoring = "WLE")
}
\arguments{
\item{dif.models}{Output from \code{\link[WBdif]{dif_models}}}

\item{irt.scoring}{What type of IRT scoring procedure should be used? Passed to the \code{method} argument of \code{\link[mirt]{fscores}}. See \code{help(fscores, mirt)}.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} of data.frames, with each \code{data.frame} summarizing the standardized effect size and standard error for the four different outcomes. The length of the list depends on whether the conditional or unconditional effect sizes were requested.
}
\description{
Compares standardized treatment effects estimated with and without adjustments for DIF.
}
\details{
Data and models are passed to \code{effect_robustness} via the \code{dif.models} argument. If \code{tx.group.id == dif.group.id}, then the unconditional standardized treatment effect is computed. If \code{tx.group.id != dif.group.id}, the standardized treatment effect is computed conditional on \code{dif.group.id} (e.g., conditional on gender), and the difference in treatment effects is also reported. The treatment effects and their standard errors are computed using the method described by Hedges (2007).

Treatment effects and their standard errors are reported for four different outcome variables.
  \itemize{
  \item The unit-weighted total score computed with all items.
  \item The unit-weighted total score computed with DIFfy items omitted (i.e. the items identified in \code{dif.models$biased.items}).
  \item IRT scores computed using a model that constrains all items to have equal parameters over levels of \code{dif.group.id} (i.e., \code{dif.models$no.dif.mod}) .
  \item IRT scores computed using a model that allows parameters of DIFfy items to vary over levels of \code{dif.group.id} (i.e., \code{dif.models$dif.mod}).
}
 IRT scores are computed using the method given by \code{irt.scoring}.

\examples{
data("mdat")

# prep data
dif.data <- dif_data_prep(item.data = mdat`[`5:ncol(mdat)],
                             dif.group.id = mdat$gender,
                             na.to.0 = TRUE)

# With user-specified biased items
dif.models <- dif_models(dif.data = dif.data, biased.items = c(1, 5, 7))
effect_robustness(dif.models = dif.models, irt.scoring = "WLE")
