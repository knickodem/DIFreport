# WBdif

**WBdif** contains functions to detect differential item functioning
(DIF), estimate treatment effects, evaluate the robustness of treatment
effects in the presence of DIF, and produce reports summarizing the
results. Development of **WBdif** was motivated by questions regarding
the psychometric properties of the early childhood development
assessments used by World Bank to evaluate intervention impacts.

The 3 main functions in \*\*WBdif\* are [`dif_analysis()`](#analysis),
[`robustness()`](#robustness), and [`dif_report()`](#report).
