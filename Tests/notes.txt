dif_prep -> data_prep
  dif.group -> dif.id
  tx.group -> tx.id
  clusters -> cluster.id
  na0 -> na.to.0

dif_analysis
  dif.group -> dif.id
  score.type -> match.var

dif_report
  dif.analysis
  file.name
  measure.name -> default = NULL -> get from dif.analysis
  dif.group.name -> dif.id.name. default = NULL -> get from dif.analysis
  dataset.name = NULL -> get from dif.analysis
  report.title = NULL -> get from data.set, measure and dif.id

  bias.method -> no longer needed, goes in robustness
  irt.scoring -> no longer needed, goes in robustness
  tx.group -> no longer needed, goes in robustness
  clusters -> no longer needed, goes in robustness

internal variable names that need to be more readable

nvi
nvgi
bi.list

inputs from dif_analysis should use the same names as the inputs
e.g.., data -> measure.data
